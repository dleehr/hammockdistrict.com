title: New SDK, Requests (Possibly) Fulfilled
---

Just finished downloading the new iPhone OS beta <span class="caps">SDK, </span>and there's some great stuff in 3.2 that will pay off in a big way for [Downloader](/downloader).  <span class="caps">USB </span>connectivity for sure.

Interestingly, Apple says these pieces are **only** on iPad, but I'm sure by the time the next iPhone OS comes out (and is the focus of an Apple event), the important pieces will be on your phone.

<span class="caps">P.S.</span> Downloader 1.40 was submitted this past weekend, hope to see that online soon.
