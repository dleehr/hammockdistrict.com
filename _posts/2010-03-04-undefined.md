title: Downloader 1.50 Released
---

[Downloader 1.50](/downloader) is now available on the App Store.  This release adds a scroll slider for quick access when viewing large documents.

Version 1.50 also features some tweaks in the <span class="caps">FAQ</span>/support screen and fixes for iPad compatibility.

A bug has been found when viewing <span class="caps">PDF</span>s in the document viewer, causing the app to crash.  This is fixed in Downloader 1.51, which is already on the way.

Update: Downloader 1.51 has just been approved and should be appearing shortly.
