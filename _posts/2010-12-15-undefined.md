---

[FLAC Player](/flacplayer/) 1.0.1 has been released to the [App Store](itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flac-player/id390532592?mt=8). &nbsp;This is is a bugfix update, addressing the following issues:

&nbsp;

*   Fixes stuttering playback on certain devices after playing several tracks
*   Increased timing for skipping to a previous song during playback
*   Other UI tweaks and performance improvements

&nbsp;

The next free update (FLAC Player 1.1.0) will add much-requested features such as repeat, shuffle, embedded FLAC Artwork, and more. &nbsp;

First though, Filer will be getting an update to 2.1
