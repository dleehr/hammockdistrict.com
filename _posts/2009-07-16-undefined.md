---

After a lengthy review process, Downloader 1.1 has been approved for sale in the App Store.  This version features bug fixes and auto-paste, and requires iPhone OS 3.0\.  Read more about it on the [product page](/downloader) or in the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=318884764)
<p>

Apple has decided that applications that allow unrestricted access to the internet must adopt a 17+ rating.  Since one of the key features of Downloader is a web browser for easier downloads, Downloader is now rated 17+.

Downloader 1.2 is in development with Landscape Mode, support for emailing downloaded files, and more!
