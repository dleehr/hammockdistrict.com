title: FLAC Player 1.3.0 Released
---

I'm happy to announce that [FLAC Player 1.3.0](/flacplayer) has been approved and released today.

[FLAC Player 1.3.0](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flac-player/id390532592?ls=1&amp;mt=8) includes a highly-anticipated 10-Band equalizer, Info display on the lock screen, the ability to exclude files from backup, and bug fixes/performance improvements.  These new features require iOS 5, and some  graphics have been updated for the new iPad.  

Many thanks to everyone that helped with this release!
