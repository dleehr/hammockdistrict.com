title: Moved to a New Site
---

Today I packed up the old site and moved to squarespace.&nbsp; So far I like it here.&nbsp; It'll let me focus on content instead of markup, and spend more time focusing on software.&nbsp; I'm definitely [on board with that](/about/).

Most of the content has been simply migrated, but I did add some new [screenshots](/filer-screenshots/) with commentary.&nbsp; If you want the filer _tech specs_, visit the [Filer product page](/filer/).&nbsp; If you want to see what it does, hit up the screenshots.

A Lite version of Filer is coming soon to replace Downloader Lite 1.30.&nbsp;

Filer (formerly Downloader) 2.0 is out in the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=318884764) now.
