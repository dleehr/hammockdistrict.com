title: FLAC Player 1.4.0
---

[FLAC Player](/flacplayer) 1.4.0 is making its way through App Stores worldwide.  This version allows you to import FLAC Files from SFTP (SSH) servers, including Mac computers, Linux hosts, NAS devices -- pretty much anything running OpenSSH.

The 1.4.0 update also includes numerous bug fixes, modernizations, and future iOS compatibility tweaks.

SFTP connectivity in FLAC Player is provided by [DLSFTPClient](http://github.com/Leehro/DLSFTPClient), a library I wrote to wrap [libssh2](http://libssh2.org).
