<p>Hello from the hammock complex, thought I'd post an update.
<p>
<p>[Downloader](/downloader) 1.2 has been getting good reviews in the app store and there are more and more users everyday.  I want to continue to improve it for all of you, and continue to make it the best file download app on the App Store.  Today I need suggestions on what features you want next.
<p>
<p>There are a lot of different directions it could go, and I've had some interesting suggestions from users (Bookmarks, Google Docs integration, support for password-protected <span class="caps">RAR</span>/ZIP files, improved <span class="caps">PDF </span>handling/navigation,...)  If you have a suggestion for an improvement or just want to vote up one of those, please send an [email](mailto:support@hammockdistrict.com) or a [tweet](http://twitter.com/leehro).
<p>
<p>In the meantime I'll be posting more info to the <span class="caps">FAQ</span>s for common issues or workflow help for downloading from common sites.  I created [Downloader](/downloader) for an audience of one, but with thousands of users around the world, I want to make sure it continues to work for all of you.
