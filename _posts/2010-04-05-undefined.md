title: Downloader 1.60 for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch!
---

After a very intense couple of months, [Downloader](/downloader) 1.60 has been released.  The big news is that it's a Universal Application for iPad and iPhone, taking advantage of many new iPad features.

There are still some refinements and improvements on the iPhone version, so I hope you'll enjoy those too.

I thought a lot about whether or not to make this an update or a new "HD" app.  Ultimately I decided to update the existing app and keep the price the same.  Anyone who has bought Downloader gets a free upgrade to the iPad version.  Much of the application was ready under the hood, and I'm very happy how well it turned out on the bigger, faster device.

The file handling and video capabilities of the new device really shine here.  I was amazed how seamless it is to tap an attachment in the iPad Mail app, and seconds later it's stored safely in Downloader.  Works the other way too, if you download or unzip a document, Downloader can send it to Pages.

I'll be adding <span class="caps">USB </span>file sharing to the app (iPad only) very soon, had to get a device in hand first.

To all my customers, thank you very much.  I hope you enjoy the latest update, whether you bought an iPad this weekend or not.
